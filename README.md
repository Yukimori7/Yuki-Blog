## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src
│   ├── assets
│   │   └── astro.svg
│   ├── components
│   │   └── Welcome.astro
│   ├── layouts
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

To learn more about the folder structure of an Astro project, refer to [our guide on project structure](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/project-structure/).

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |

| `pnpm dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `pnpm build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `pnpm preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |

## 🔎 Fetch GitHub issues into content

Fetch all open issues from a GitHub repository and save them as markdown files under `src/content/blog`:

```sh
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token pnpm fetch:issues -- <owner> <repo>
```

You can also set `GITHUB_OWNER` and `GITHUB_REPO` environment variables instead of passing CLI arguments. Providing a GitHub token is optional but recommended to avoid hitting API rate limits. The script names each file using the pattern `<issue.id>_<issue title>.md` and copies the issue body into the markdown content.
